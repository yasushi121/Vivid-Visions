      <p class="Intro">Art is the timeless language of humanity — a reflection of emotion, culture, and imagination. Throughout history, great painters have used brush and canvas not only to capture the world around them but to reveal the depths of the human soul. From the swirling intensity of Van Gogh’s skies to the serene mystery of da Vinci’s portraits, these masters transformed ordinary scenes into extraordinary visions. Their works broke boundaries, defined eras, and continue to shape the way we see beauty, truth, and ourselves. Though centuries may pass, the legacy of these artists endures — living on in the colors, textures, and stories they left behind.</p>

              <p>Michelangelo's frescoes on the ceiling of The Sistine chapel are considered some of the greatest examples of Renaissance painting. There are over 300 figures depicting the stories from the book of Genesis. The series begins at the door with Noah and ends with the separation of Light from Darkness. The reason for the inversion of the painting was not noted in any of Michelangelo's pieces.</p>

              <p>The Last Judgement by Michelangelo spans across the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Italy. It is certainly not a passive piece of art and is made to elicit awe and fear, depicting over 300 (mostly nude) figures surrounding the central figure of Christ, all dynamically engaged. The emotional fury of their gestures, emphasizes their vulnerability in the midst of the chaos around them.</p>

              <p>The Creation of Adam is renowned for its striking composition and emotional depth. The painting depicts two central figures: God, surrounded by a group of angels, and Adam, who reclines on a barren landscape. Their outstretched hands nearly touch, with only a sliver of space separating them. This narrow gap has come to symbolize the spark of life and the profound connection between the divine and humanity.</p>
